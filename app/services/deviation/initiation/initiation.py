                You are a language model that receives audio transcriptions related to quality and change management processes. Your task is to analyze the transcription and extract structured meeting information.

                The following are the inputs:

                - {input_data.existing_incident_title}: (Optional) Previously extracted incident title, if any. If it exists, use it unless in transcription there is a specific mention; if not, generate a new one.
                - {input_data.transcribed_text}: The full transcript up to this point (latest cumulative 10-second update).
                - {input_data.existing_background_details}: (Optional) Previously extracted background details, if any.
                - {input_data.existing_background_attendee}: (Optional) List of previously known attendee names.
                - {input_data.existing_impact_assessment}: (Optional) Previously extracted impact assessment data, if any.
                - {input_data.existing_criticality}: (Optional) Previously extracted criticality, if any.

                ---

                Your output must follow this strict JSON schema with exactly **five fields**:

                1. Incident Title (string):Previously extracted incident title, if any. If it exists, use it unless in transcription there is a specific mention; if not, generate a new one.
                
                2."background_details" (json): A JSON object with the following keys:
                    - "Who"
                    - "What"
                    - "Where"
                    - "Immediate_Action"
                    - "Quality_Concerns"
                    - "Quality_Controls"
                    - "RCA_tool"
                    - "Expected_Interim_Action"
                    - "CAPA"

                    ⚠️ Each field must be included, even if not mentioned — in that case, return an empty string "".

                ---

                3. "background_attendee" (List of String): A list of attendee names. If none are found, return an empty list.

                ---

                4. "impact_assessment" (json): A Nested JSON object with four fields:
                    - "Product_Quality"
                    - "Patient_Safety"
                    - "Regulatory_Impact"
                    - "Validation_Impact"

                Each of these four fields must be an dictionary object with:
                    - `"impact"`: "Yes" or "No".
                    - `"severity"`: One of "Low", "Medium", "High" if impact is "Yes", or "" if impact is "No".

                ✅ Examples:
                - "Product_Quality": {{ "impact": "Yes", "severity": "Medium" }}
                - "Patient_Safety": {{ "impact": "No", "severity": "" }}

                5. "criticality" (string): The criticality level of the incident "Major" or "Minor". If you can't determine the criticality or not mentioned explicitly, return an empty string.

                ---

                ### Instructions:

                1. Correct any transcription errors in `input.transcribed_text`.
                2. Use the full transcript to extract structured information.
                3. Incorporate previously extracted details (from `input.background_details`, etc.) where applicable.
                4. If new information contradicts or improves prior data, update it.
                5. All keys must be present in the output structure.
                6. Respond ONLY with valid JSON — no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks.

           Deviation ID: [To be assigned]
           Date/Time of Occurrence: 19-Sep-2025, 15:00 hrs
           Location: Tableting Line 5
           Product: Analgesic (Over-the-Counter)
           Dosage Form: Tablets

        2. Background
           On 19-Sep-2025, 15:00 hrs during routine in-process checks on Tableting Line 5, low tablet weights were detected. The weights were below the specified limits. This deviation was identified by production operators during scheduled sampling.
           
           Personnel involved include Michael E. Saidi M. Rana S.
           
           Immediate Action
           Quarantined all tablets manufactured since the last acceptable in-process weight check. Halted further compression activity until investigation initiated. Secured equipment to prevent unintended use. Notified QA and initiated deviation record. Batch records and machine settings reviewed at line.
           
           Quality Concerns/Controls
           Product Quality Impact: Potential for sub-potent (ineffective) product reaching patients if not detected. Validation Impact: Question raised on validated status of equipment and process stability; possibility of drift in machine settings or inadequate process controls. Compliance Gaps: Need to verify adequacy of in-process check frequency, operator training, and equipment calibration/qualification status.
           
           RCA Tools
           Root Cause Analysis Due to potential major criticality the root cause tool selected is fishbone analysis.
           
           Expected Interim action
           Not discussed
           
           CAPA
           Not discussed.

        3. Meeting Attendees
           Michael E. Saidi M. Rana S.

        4. Impact Assessment
           Rationale: Deviation may impact product quality (low tablet weights → sub-potent dose) but no immediate patient safety risk as deviation was detected during in-process checks and impacted batch portion quarantined. Validation impact identified resulting in major criticality. Customer notification to be identified via QTA review.

        5. Criticality
           Criticality: Major
           
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON with the five requested sections. No explanations, no markdown code blocks, just the JSON object.

           Immediate Action
           Quarantined all tablets manufactured since the last acceptable in-process weight check. Halted further compression activity until investigation initiated. Secured equipment to prevent unintended use. Notified QA and initiated deviation record. Batch records and machine settings reviewed at line.
           
           Quality Concerns/Controls
           Product Quality Impact: Potential for sub-potent (ineffective) product reaching patients if not detected. Validation Impact: Question raised on validated status of equipment and process stability; possibility of drift in machine settings or inadequate process controls. Compliance Gaps: Need to verify adequacy of in-process check frequency, operator training, and equipment calibration/qualification status.

        4. Impact Assessment
           Rationale: Deviation may impact product quality (low tablet weights → sub-potent dose) but no immediate patient safety risk as deviation was detected during in-process checks and impacted batch portion quarantined. Validation impact identified resulting in major criticality. Customer notification to be identified via QTA review.

        5. Criticality
           Criticality: Major
